        <ul>
            <li>Implemented this changelog.</li>
            <li>
                Implemented a json based series pages auto generation using
                Gatsby's API. Caveat is the loss of per page customization such
                as previous S;G tu-tu-ru when changing episodes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bugfix: json file slug field must have a / before the slug to be
                rooted in the page, not having it results in the page being
                linked in /series/ instead of the root. Added a / before the
                offending fields. Where this prefix comes from I have no idea.
            </li>

                Bugfix: custom 404 not working, implemented a manual redirect to
                the 404 page, this is necessary because of broken urls.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>v0.2.1</h4>
        <ul><li>Deployed spoiler version of FSN.</li></ul>

        <h4>v0.2.0</h4>
        <ul>

                states between series.
            </li>
            <li>Validated linking between pages.</li>
